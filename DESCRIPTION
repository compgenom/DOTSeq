Description: 
    A flexible beta-binomial generalized linear model (GLM) framework for 
    modeling the expected proportion of ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to 
    RNA-seq counts for individual open reading frames (ORFs) relative to 
    other ORFs within the same gene. This is complemented by a negative 
    binomial GLM framework that captures changes in translation efficiency 
    of individual ORFs across experimental conditions.
