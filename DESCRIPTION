Description: 
  DOTSeq is a statistical framework for detecting differential translation at 
  the open reading frame (ORF) level using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and 
  matched RNA-seq data. Unlike gene-level tools, DOTSeq models translation 
  dynamics within genes, enabling discovery of differential ORF usage and 
  translation efficiency. It uses a flexible beta-binomial generalized linear 
  model (GLM) framework to capture subtle regulatory signals, such as 
  upstream ORF-mediated control, across diverse biological conditions.
