CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0

- Unified Workflow: The DOTSeq() wrapper function provides a streamlined 
  interface for performing Differential ORF Translation analysis, while also 
  exposing modular steps for advanced customisation.

- Data Structure: SummarizedExperiment is used as the foundational class for 
  organising input data, model outputs, and metadata.

- Bayesian Inference: Differential ORF Usage (DOU) is assessed using adaptive 
  shrinkage via the ashr package, yielding posterior summaries such as 
  PosteriorMean and local false sign rates (LFSR) for robust effect size 
  estimation and uncertainty quantification.
