\title{Plot Venn Diagram of DTE and DOU Significance Overlap}
\usage{
plot_venn(results, dou_padj_col = "lfsr", dte_padj_col = "padj")
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A data frame containing DTE and DOU results. Must include row names
corresponding to ORF identifiers, and columns for adjusted p-values from both tests.}

\item{dou_padj_col}{Character string specifying the column name for DOU significance values.
Should correspond to local false sign rate (lfsr). Default is \code{"lfsr"}.}

\item{dte_padj_col}{Character string specifying the column name for DTE adjusted p-values.
Default is \code{"padj"}.}
}
\value{
A Venn diagram (Euler plot) showing the number of ORFs significant in DTE only,
DOU only, or both.
}
\description{
Generates a Venn diagram (Euler diagram) showing the overlap of significantly
differentially translated ORFs (DTE) and differentially used ORFs (DOU).
ORFs are classified as significant in DTE only, DOU only, or both.
}
\details{
Significance is determined using a threshold of 0.05 on the adjusted p-values.
The plot uses a color-blind friendly palette and includes counts for each region.
