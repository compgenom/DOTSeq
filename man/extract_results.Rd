\title{Extract Model Results into a Unified Data Frame}
\usage{
extract_results(sumExp, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sumExp}{A SummarizedExperiment object containing fitted model objects
stored in \code{rowData(sumExp)[['DOUResults']]}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, messages will be printed for skipped or failed models.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row corresponds to an ORF and its associated model results.
Columns include scalar parameters extracted from the model, \code{orf_id}, and \code{model_type}.
}
\description{
Extracts scalar results from a named list of model objects (typically from \code{glmmTMB} fits)
into a tidy data frame. Handles nested lists, missing or \code{NULL} models, and ensures
consistent columns across all entries.
}
\details{
The function uses a recursive helper (\code{flatten_scalars}) to extract scalar values
from nested lists. It supports models of type \code{"glmmTMB"} and \code{"glmmTMB_joint"},
and gracefully handles \code{NULL} or unsupported model types by returning minimal rows.

Missing columns across models are filled with \code{NA} to ensure a consistent structure.
