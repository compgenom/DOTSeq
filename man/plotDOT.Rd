\title{Plot DTE vs DOT Comparison and Venn Diagram}
\usage{
plotDOT(dot)
}
\arguments{
\item{dot}{A list containing two data frames: \code{dteRes} and \code{dotRes},
each with rownames as ORF IDs and columns including \code{padj}, \code{log2FoldChange},
\code{empirical.fdr}, and \code{estimates}.}
}
\value{
Generates two plots: a scatter plot of DTE vs DOT estimates, and a Venn diagram
showing the overlap of significant ORFs.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the relationship between differential translation efficiency (DTE)
and differential ORF translation (DOT) using a scatter plot and a Venn diagram.
It highlights ORFs that are significant in either or both tests and uses a color-blind friendly palette.
