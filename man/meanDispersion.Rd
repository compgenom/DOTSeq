\title{Plot and Extract Dispersion Estimates from DOU Models}
\usage{
meanDispersion(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A list-like object returned by \code{DOTSeq::fitDOT}, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{sumExp}: A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object with satuRn DTU model fits in the \code{rowData} under \code{"fitDTUModels"}, and a \code{"counts"} assay.
\item \code{dds}: A \code{DESeqDataSet} object from DESeq2 used for DTE analysis.
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{meanProportions}{A numeric vector of mean proportions of ORF counts relative to their parent gene.}
\item{originalDispersions}{A numeric vector of dispersion estimates from the original GLM fit.}
\item{posteriorDispersions}{A numeric vector of posterior (empirical Bayes regularized) dispersion estimates.}
}
}
\description{
This function extracts and compares original and posterior dispersion estimates
from DOU (Differential ORF Usage) models fitted using \code{DOTSeq::fitDOT}. It also computes
mean proportions of ORF-level counts relative to their parent gene, and visualizes
the relationship between mean proportion and dispersion. Additionally, it plots
dispersion estimates from the DESeq2 model used in the DTE (Differential Translation Efficiency) analysis.
}
\details{
The function assumes that row names of the count matrix follow the format \code{"geneID:orfID"}.
It calculates the proportion of each ORF's counts relative to the total counts of its parent gene,
and plots both original and posterior dispersion estimates against these mean proportions.

The posterior dispersions are generally more stable and recommended for downstream hypothesis testing.
The function also calls \code{plotDispEsts()} to visualize dispersion estimates from the DESeq2 model.
