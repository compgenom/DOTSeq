\title{Plot and Extract Dispersion Estimates from DOU Models}
\usage{
meanDispersion(sumExp)
}
\arguments{
\item{sumExp}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing DTU model fits in the \code{rowData} under the satuRn \code{"fitDTUModels"} column,
and a \code{"counts"} assay representing ORF-level count data.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{meanProportions}{A numeric vector of mean proportions of ORF counts relative to their parent gene.}
\item{originalDispersions}{A numeric vector of dispersion estimates from the original GLM fit.}
\item{posteriorDispersions}{A numeric vector of posterior (empirical Bayes regularized) dispersion estimates.}
}
}
\description{
This function extracts and compares original and posterior dispersion estimates
from DOU (Differential ORF Usage) models stored in a \code{SummarizedExperiment} object.
It also computes mean proportions of ORF-level counts relative to their parent gene,
and visualizes the relationship between mean proportion and dispersion.
}
\details{
The function assumes that row names of the count matrix follow the format \code{"geneID:orfID"}.
It calculates the proportion of each ORF's counts relative to the total counts of its parent gene,
and plots both original and posterior dispersion estimates against these mean proportions.

The posterior dispersions are generally more stable and recommended for downstream hypothesis testing.
