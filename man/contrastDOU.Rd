\title{Compute Differential ORF Usage (DOU) Contrasts Using Estimated Marginal Means}
\usage{
contrastDOU(
  m,
  emm_specs = ~condition * strategy,
  contrasts_method = "pairwise",
  workers = 1,
  BPPARAM = BiocParallel::bpparam(),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A named list or SummarizedExperiment-like object containing fitted model objects
(e.g., from \code{glmmTMB}) stored in \code{rowData(m$sumExp)[['fitDOUModels']]}.}

\item{emm_specs}{A formula specifying the structure of the estimated marginal means.
Default is \code{~condition * strategy}.}

\item{contrasts_method}{Character string specifying the method for computing contrasts.
Default is \code{"pairwise"}.}

\item{workers}{Integer. Number of parallel workers to use. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{BPPARAM}{A BiocParallel parameter object for parallel execution.
Default is \code{BiocParallel::bpparam()}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints progress messages. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A named list with two components:
\describe{
\item{interaction_specific}{A list of contrast-specific data frames containing:
\code{beta}, \code{se}, \code{PosteriorMean}, \code{lfsr}, and \code{qvalue}.}
\item{strategy_specific}{A nested list of contrast-strategy combinations with the same structure.}
}
}
\description{
This function performs Differential ORF Usage (DOU) analysis by computing contrasts
between ribosome profiling and RNA-seq modalities using estimated marginal means (EMMs)
from fitted GLMM models. It supports both interaction-specific and strategy-specific contrasts,
and applies empirical Bayes shrinkage via the \code{ashr} package to stabilize effect size estimates.
}
\details{
The function first extracts valid EMM objects from the fitted models. For each contrast,
it computes the difference in effect sizes between ribosome profiling and RNA-seq (DOU),
estimates the standard error, and applies shrinkage using \code{ashr::ash}.

Strategy-specific contrasts are computed separately for each modality (strategy).
This function is designed to support benchmarking and downstream statistical analysis
of differential translation at the ORF level.
