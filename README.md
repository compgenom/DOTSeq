# DOTSeq
DOTSeq is a R package for identifying differentially translated open reading frames (ORFs) from paired Ribo- and RNAseq data. Most existing tools operate at gene level, DOTSeq performs analysis at the ORF level, enabling the detection of differential translation between conditions, and occupancy shifts of ribosomes on ORFs within a single gene.
